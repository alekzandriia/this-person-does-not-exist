I've been listening to lots of CyberSecurity & OSINT podcasts & decided to use this API to create a [sock puppet](https://www.cybervie.com/blog/what-is-sock-puppets-in-osint-how-to-create-one/) generator!

The typewriter title effect was achieved using the same method I used to achieve the [CSS Typewriter Effect](https://codepen.io/alekzandriia/pen/QWmZdmX).
